# Sierpinski Triangle
Compile and run either sierpinski_triangle.py or sierpinski-color.py to see a 
cool optical illusion of triangles within triangles, within triangles! 

IllusionHelper.py is a program creates methods for certain shapes to be drawn. 
We will only need the triangle method for this program. 

sierpinski_triangle.py contains the base code for this program. It draws the 
illusion in black and white lines at a set size in the code. The size and location
of the Sierpinski Triangle can be changed on line #21. 

sierpinski-color.py is a version of sierpinski_triangle.py but with color and 
filled-in triangles
